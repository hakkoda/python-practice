= LinkedList stuff, Python style =

- merge two linked lists into one sorted list
- create a search function, returns the node of the searched item
- write a function to determine if the list is in order
- create a swap function
- enforce the data type
- break up tests into separate files
- setup tags file for main.py

----

= DONE =

- create an insert function
- find the node with the smallest value
- sort a linked list in ascending order - done, but might need more testing
- sort a linked list in descending order - done, but might need more testing
- reverse a linked list
- find the node with the largest value

----

Setup exuberant ctags - trying to integrate this efficiently into the project
