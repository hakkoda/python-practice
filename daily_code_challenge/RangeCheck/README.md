Write a function which given num, first, and last, where num is an integer
array; first and last are integers, returns the location of the smallest element
from num[first] to num[last].

Example:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[ 5 2 0 9 8 4 1 2 7 6 ]

first = 0
last = 5

range set:
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[ 5 2 0 9 8 4 1 2 7 6 ]
  -----------
  
We're concerned with 5 0 9 8 4 with 0 being the smallest element in that set at
position 2, so 2 should be returned.

Using this function, write a function to sort num in ascending order
