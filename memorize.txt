A good exercise would be to do the following:
1) Get user input to get a filename (argv or input) for input/output
2) Get user input to write to a file
3) Read in the contents of the file
4) Display the contents of the file to screen
5) Display the contents of the file again, one line at a time
6) Encapsulate functionality in function calls


from sys import argv
script, first, second, third = argv


likes = input(prompt)


txt = open(filename)
contents = txt.read()
txt.close()


target = open(filename, 'w')
target.truncate()
target.write(line1)
target.close()


from os.path import exists
isFile = exists(filename)

readline
seek

functions
